SHORT_DESCRIPTION = 'Foghorn is a configurable DNS proxy to allow for black-, white-, and greylisting of DNS resources.'

LONG_DESCRIPTION = '''Foghorn is a configurable DNS proxy to allow for
black-, white-, and greylisting of DNS resources.

foghorn MUST be positioned within a network with egress filtering enabled
for DNS - only the local resolver can be allowed to make outbound requests
for DNS.

Also, squid or some similar proxy should be in place to filter naked
IP requests, in order to mitigate the possibility of certain workarounds
that would otherwise be available to attackers.

After baselining, the workstations that you desire to protect should be
configured to use the foghorn server as their DNS resolver, and any ACLs
adjusted accordingly.
